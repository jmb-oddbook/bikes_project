# Capital Bike Share Project

This was the third project of CAB. It focused on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and working with time series.

>With environmental issues and health becoming trending topics, the usage of bicycles as a mode of transportation has gained popularity in recent years. To encourage bike usage, cities across the world have successfully implemented bike-sharing programs. Under such schemes, riders can rent bicycles using manual/automated kiosks spread across the city for defined periods. In most cases, riders can pick up bikes from one location and return them to any other designated place.<br />
>Bike riders reduce traffic congestion as they form a valid substitution for cars on short/medium trips, contribute to the use of public transport by providing effective last-mile connectivity, and simply take up less space on the road. The characteristics of data being generated by these systems also make an attractive option for the researchers who can try to understand traffic routes in a city." [CAB]



## Part 1 -- Data wrangling
Datasets:
* Bike sharing data set : This dataset comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) and has been augmented by weather, seasonal, and calendric data. It contains the years 2011 and 2012.
* Trip history data : Can be downloaded for the years 2010 up to the last month (here: April 2022) from [Capital Bikeshare](https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) *sub* Trip History Data.
* Station information data set : Can be downloaded as json from [Capital Bikeshare](https://ride.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) *sub* Real Time Data. *Note* that there is no information when the respective station was opened or if the station was moved during it's existence.

The Capital Bikeshare System Data website also offers supplementary material such as member surveys and summaries.
